This is my second Bot project
It has several commands such as /echo, /start
It would react to message such as "Happy New Year" and "Carlson"

I enjoy coding this bot a lot, I learned the use of API and telegrambot functions
In the next patch/update, I'll add comment to each line of code.
This could help me refreshing my memory when I'm accessing the code.
